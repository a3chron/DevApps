# Contributing

First of all, thanks to all contributors :)

## First Important Things

- If you found a bug, do NOT open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability, and instead to refer to our [security policy](./SECURITY.md).
- If the bug is not security relevant (most of them are not in this application), we'll be happy if you open an Issue.

## Issues

- Please use one of the Templates when creating an Issue (and the right one), only when your Issue is not a feature request, app request, or bug, you can use the blank Issue.
